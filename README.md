# caravan-SOB-2025-POC
# Project Overview

This repository contains my proposal and initial plans to integrate a Wallet Health Dashboard into the Caravan multisig coordinator. The main objective is to empower users with tools to assess the health of their Bitcoin wallets—focusing on privacy and waste—using real-time analysis of transaction drafts and historical wallet activity. This will bridge the gap between existing backend analysis (via the @caravan/health package) and a clean, intuitive UI experience, making advanced wallet insights accessible to all Caravan users.

# Why This Matters
Caravan makes multisig Bitcoin setups more accessible, but understanding the privacy and efficiency of your wallet often requires deep domain knowledge. Without visual, actionable feedback, users may unknowingly compromise on privacy or waste funds due to suboptimal coin selection strategies.

This project addresses that by:

Surfacing meaningful insights about transaction structures before signing or publishing.

Helping users understand tradeoffs between privacy and waste.

Building intuitive dashboards that educate users on best practices in Bitcoin wallet management.

The result will be a more secure, informed, and user-friendly Caravan experience.
